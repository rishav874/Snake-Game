# Snake-Game

The snake game has been a beloved classic in the world of video games for decades, captivating players with its simple yet addictive gameplay. The objective of the game is to guide a snake through a playing field, consuming food (represented by fruits) to grow in length, while avoiding collisions with the walls or the snake's own body.
In this project, we aim to develop a snake game using the Python programming language, leveraging the power of the Pygame library to create an engaging and visually appealing gaming experience. Python's versatility and the extensive ecosystem of libraries make it an excellent choice for game development, allowing developers to focus on the core game logic and user interaction without getting bogged down by low-level implementation details.

# Following libraries and modules in Python:

1.	Turtle:
The turtle module is used for creating graphics and shapes in a window.
Functions like turtle.Screen(), turtle.Turtle(), and methods like turtle.speed(), turtle.shape(), turtle.color(), turtle.penup(), turtle.pendown(), turtle.goto(), turtle.forward(), turtle.right(), turtle.hideturtle(), turtle.onkeypress(), turtle.listen(), turtle.update(), turtle.clear(), turtle.bgcolor(), turtle.write(), turtle.setx(), turtle.sety(), turtle.distance(), turtle.sleep(), turtle.Terminator() are used for creating the game interface, controlling the snake, food, scoring, and handling game events.

2.	Random:
The random module is used for generating random numbers for positioning the food and creating a challenging game environment.

3.	Time:
The time module is used for introducing time delays in the game loop, controlling the game speed, and handling game over scenarios.
